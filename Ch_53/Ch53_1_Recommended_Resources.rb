I recommend you check out some of these projects and try to build something with them:
The Well-Grounded Rubyist to continue your Ruby study and become better at it.
Eloquent Ruby for even more Ruby skill.
Learn Python The Hard Way You will learn even more about programming as you learn more programming languages, so try learning Python too.
Rails Tutorial to learn Ruby on Rails.
RubyMotion For building building native iOS applications.
Thor to build command line tools.
Mechanize for automatic web crawling and scraping.
Chef Solo for automating system administration.
Ruby-Processing for computer art.
Padrino is like Sinatra but with a lot more features to work more like Ruby on Rails.
Learn C The Hard Way after you're familiar with Ruby, try learning C and algorithms with my other book. Take it slow; C is different but a very good thing to learn.
Pick one of the preceding resources, and go through any tutorials and documentation they have. As you go through documentation with code in it, type in all of the code and make it work. That's how I do it. That's how every programmer does it. Reading programming documentation is not enough to learn it; you have to do it. After you get through the tutorial and any other documentation they have, make something. Anything will do, even something someone else has already written. Just make something.
