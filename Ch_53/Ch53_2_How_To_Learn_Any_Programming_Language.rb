=begin
Get a book or some introductory text about the language.
Go through the book and type in all of the code making all of it run.
Read the book as you work on the code, taking notes.
Use the language to implement a small set of programs you are familiar with in another language.
Read other people's code in the language, and try to copy their patterns.

The preceding process also works for new technologies, assuming they have books you can read. For anything without books, you do the above process but use online documentation or source code as your initial introduction.
Each new language you learn makes you a better programmer, and as you learn more they become easier to learn. By your third or fourth language you should be able to pick up similar languages in a week, with stranger languages taking longer. Now that you know Ruby you could potentially learn Python and JavaScript fairly quickly by comparison. This is simply because many languages share similar concepts, and once you learn the concepts in one language they work in others.
