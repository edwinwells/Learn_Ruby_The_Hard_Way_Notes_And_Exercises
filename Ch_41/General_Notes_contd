CODE STRUCTURE:

class X < y
"Make a class named X that is-a Y."
"Make a class named ??? that is-a Y."
OR, more familiarly:
class ComputerSequential < Player
"Make a class named ComputerSequential that is-a Player."

class X: def initialize(J)
"class X has-a initialize that takes a J parameter."
"class ??? has-a initialize that takes ??? parameters."

class X: def M(J)
"class X has-a function named M that takes a J parameter."
"class ??? has-a function named ??? that takes ??? parameters."

foo = X.new()
"Set foo to an instance of class X."
"Set ??? to an instance of class ???."

foo.M(J)
"From foo, get the M function, and call it with parameter J."
"From ???, get the ??? function, and call it with parameters ???."

foo.K = Q
"From foo, get the K attribute, and set it to Q."
"From ???, get the ??? attribute, and set it to ???."
